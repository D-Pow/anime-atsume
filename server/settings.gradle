 * `group` and `version` usually have to be defined in `build.gradle`.
 * However, we can collect all these settings together here by adding a hook
 * to inject them right before `build.gradle` is executed and still maintain the
 * same behavior.
 * This fixes Gradle's "bug" of violating the principle of separation of concerns
 * and helps keep code nice and clean.
