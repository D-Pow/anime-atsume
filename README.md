An overly simplistic website for finding and watching anime.

### About

We've all been there: you visit some website to watch your favorite show just to be bombarded with ads, weird click-bait, and worst of all, those invisible buttons positioned right over the video that open to a sketchy tab when you try to click "play."

This site is intended to be the exact opposite: overly simplistic, easy to use interface, and the quickest possible access to watching your show.
