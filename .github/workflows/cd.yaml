# If we decide to use Docker - Using local Dockerfile in pipeline:
#   steps:
#   - name: Check out code
#     uses: actions/checkout@v3
#   - name: Build docker images
#     run: docker build -t local < .devcontainer/Dockerfile # .devcontainer is the local path
#   - name: Run tests
#     run: docker run -it -v $PWD:/srv -w/srv local make test
#  OR
#   - name: Build docker images
#     run: docker-compose build
#   - name: Run tests
#     run: docker-compose run test

# Multiple ways to do this, including:
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  # Run after CI. Note that this is done here specifically because this repo doesn't utilize GitHub releases.
  workflow_run:
    branches: [ master ]
    workflows: [ 'CI' ]
    types: [ completed ]
  # # 1. Publish your release in GitHub and have your pipeline
  # # react to deploy the package
  # release:
  #   types: [published]

  # 2. Run the pipeline on merge to `master` and do the release/deploy then.
  # pull_request:
  #   types: [ closed ]
  #   branches: [ master ]

  # 3. Run on CI completion (the `if:` in the `deploy` job below would need updating accordingly)
  # workflow_run:
  #   branches: [ master ]
  #   workflows: [ 'CI' ]
  #   types: [ completed ]
